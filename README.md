# ðŸŒ™ðŸŒ¸ nominal

a minimal, dark theme with a pop of color that hopes to improve the design - at least a little bit.<br />

<img alt="preview" src="https://milkembers.github.io/nominal/assets/preview.png">

## features

- cute accent colours for checkboxes and selections
- blurred context menus and backdrops
- hides many small annoyances like the nitro shop, avatar decorations and welcome stickers
- <s>nitro colour theme friendly</s> (needs a little work after the 10/23 update, not likely to fix)

## usage

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> make sure to enable dark mode in settings for the theme to apply properly!

### Vencord (or client without local theme folder)

@import this link or paste it in your Vencord themes tab:

```
https://milkembers.github.io/nominal/nominal.min.css
```
### in-browser / web app

click to [install with Stylus](nominal.user.css)

> [!NOTE]
> due to limitations, the Stylus theme has reduced functionality and will not hide annoyances
